## About project

[Project's Page](https://murilo-rainho.github.io/trybewarts/)

This project was made during my second week in the second month on the Trybe Course. Me, without knowledge before the course, **with two month of course**, was able to use some basic knowledge about HTML, CSS and JavaScript, focusing on **forms** in this project.

---

### what is the site for?

This project was made just to simulate a **form** *(does not send to any server)* and show my knowledge in this area.

---

### HTML

The focus of this project was the form, that is, the html. I used things like:
* `form`;
* Sections to divide `form`;
* `label`s and `input`s;
* A submit `button` that is disabled until you agree to the terms.

---

### CSS

In the CSS, I used basic knowledges like:
* `display: flex;`;
* `transition:`;
* `@media screen`;
* Pseudo-class;
* Select `input` styling.

---

### JavaScript

With JS, I basically just used to style the select as its option is changed and to activate the submit button when agreeing to the terms.
